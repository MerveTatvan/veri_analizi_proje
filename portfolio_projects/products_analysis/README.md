# 📊 Data Analysis Portfolio

This repository contains my data analysis learning journey and portfolio projects.
It is structured to clearly separate **training exercises**, **experiments**, and **CV-ready portfolio projects**.

The goal of this repository is to demonstrate my ability to:
- Work with real-world datasets
- Clean, analyze, and interpret data
- Organize analysis projects in a professional structure
- Use Python and data analysis libraries effectively

## 🧪 Training Projects

The `training_projects` folder contains notebooks created during my data analysis training.
Each folder represents a specific topic or day and focuses on hands-on practice.

Topics include:
- Python fundamentals for data analysis
- Pandas data manipulation
- Data cleaning techniques
- Filtering, sorting, and grouping operations
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
